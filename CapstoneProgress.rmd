Predictive text project
======================================================================

# Synopsis

The objective of this project is to build an algorithm capable of predicting the next word in a sentence given one or more previous words. This algorithm is meant to be used in text messages, for instance.
To make the analysis possible, we have been supplied with a copora consisting of three sources of text: blogs, news and tweets. 
We have received similar sets in 4 different languages. For the purpose of this exploratory analysis we'll concentrate on the English corpora.

### Initial Analysis.

The data has been downloaded from 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip

Using Notepad++ we get the basic summary of the data:

blog.txt
chars 206824505
words 37896970
lines 899289

twitter.txt
chars 162385042
words 30375465
lines 2360149

news.txt
chars 203223159
words 35668184
lines 1010243

Perusing the content of the files we can observe that twitters present the biggest challenge due to the jargon, abbreviations and non english speelling used in this kind of communication.
Also, as shown in the summary, the mean length of the tweet lines is around 15 words, which means short sentences and therefore more difficult to predict words based on line context.


# Data Processing

### Download and extract:

```{r eval=FALSE}
download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip",temp)

unzip(zipfile="files.zip",exdir="./temp")
```

### read data

```{r eval=FALSE}
blog<-readLines("./final/en_US/en_US.blogs.txt")
```

### Analysing the data

As we are dealing with natural language processing (NLP) a good way to start is with the tokenization of the data (i.e. we'll break the text up into words in this case).
In our research we found that the tm package is a good option for this purpose, but given the size of the file we are working with, we'll work on a sample of about 10% of the lines.


# Findings

This exploratory analysis provide some very useful findings especially regarding the challenges we'll face when building our prediction model:

- Due to the amount of data available, we may need to work on data samples to minimise the performance issues.
- Tweets may not be useful-at least, initially- as they will add too much noise to the corpora.
